This is the ReadMe.txt for salt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk

Following FileStructure

ArtWork
 - Anything to do with arts for this project goes here
 - especially the files needed to create any gfx like gimp or photoshop files

AutoHotkey
 - The salt script home
 - every part gets an own subdirectory

php
 - The backend goes in here
   If it's neccessary to represent a complete structure for a webserver, it's
   best to put it into a www directory and establish in there all files such
   as htdocs, includes, db etc

Special Folder:
 - DemoFiles are files meant to show a specific solution for an issue
 - Files not needed anymore, but worth to keep instead of deleting 'em
