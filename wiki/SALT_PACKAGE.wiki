#summary Definition of SALT-PACKAGE file

===SALT PACKAGE ===

A valid salt PACKAGE has the following dir/name specification:
{{{
[PACKAGENAME]-[VERSION].7z.salt
/data              //Data folder which holds all relevant data
/descriptor.yml    //SALT DESCRIPTOR
}}}

All downloaded PACKAGES are copyed into the salt install cache.
_Note: This design allows offline installing, pre downloading, caching and so on_



==SALT DESCRIPTOR==

The SALT-DESCRIPTOR is a yml file ("descriptor.yml"). The used file format is yaml, an xml like format, with low overhead. 
The descriptor includes all necessary information about a package - like dependecies, version information, description, genre type, install instructions...



==SALT install instructions==

SALT bases on the concept of a package manager like APT. So the salt core design should not be limited to std Lib files.
Therefore, the install instructions has to be defined. Dependecies must NOT be handled here, as they are handled(cheched,updated, installed) by saltservice before.

The install instructions are a set of very basic commands;
{{{
#copy /data/stdlib.ahk %stdlib%\stdlib.ahk
#exec /my_own_installer.exe
}}}
If a PACKAGE needs more control over installation process, the #exec command should be used to start a user definied exe or ahk script. This limts salt in some ways, minory in the deinstallation process, which bases on the install instructions. 

==SALT PACKAGE UNINSTALL==

First, a PACKAGE can only be uninstalled, if there arn't any other Packages, which depend on it. On the other hand, PACKAGES which has installed other PACKAGES, may uninstall these too for cleanup purposes. The uninstall process can be the reverse of the installation script (so it can be autogenerated) ~ or a user defined ahk/exe file.

_SALT INSTALL/UNINSTALL is subject to discuss anyway_
