#summary saltservice

== Introduction ==

*saltservice* is the core of the local SALT Client. Started directly it shows up a easy to use GUI. 
But *saltservice* can also be used as service, due it's implementation of IPC. 
The IPC communication is internaly used by the *saltserviceAPI* to fully remotecontrol saltservice.
The *saltserviceAPI* allows 3th party tools to easy use the SALT package manager, for example to perform a installation/update of a stdLib file.


== Saltservice API==

The API is mainly a collection of Wrapper-Functions for the InterProc communication (IPC) to get easy access to the saltservice and control it.

_more information comes soon _

==Repository Management==

The local Salt Service can have any count of Repos which are checked out. The Repos can have redundancy (to secure the avaiability), but don't must have it. 

_Furter, first implementation of SALT will have only support for StdLibs, but this may change in furter releases to support any scripts with own install instructions._

This will work compareable to apt-get under Ubuntu Linux.
