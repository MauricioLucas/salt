#summary saltservice

== Introduction ==

*saltservice* is the core of the local SALT Client. It's a service which offers all functionalitys true the easy saltservice API to all other Applications.

The Client-GUI will use the API and even 3th party scripts can use the API to enforce StdLib Installations/Checks.



== Saltservice API==

The API is mainly a collection of Wrapper-Functions for the InterProc communication to get easy access to the saltservice and control it.

_more information comes soon _

==Repository Management==

The local Salt Service can have any count of Repos which are checked out. The Repos can have redundancy (to secure the avaiability), but don't must have it. 

_Furter, first implementation of SALT will have only support for StdLibs, but this may change in furter releases to support any scripts with own install instructions._

This will work compareable to apt-get under Linux.


==saltservice GUIs:==

_this a idea only and subject to change_

The saltservice will have some GUIs, but they are all of informative nature only. (To inform the user about download/install progress.)
